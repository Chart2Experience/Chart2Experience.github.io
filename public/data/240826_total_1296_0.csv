64,6,6,7,5,2,7,4,COVID,12,Easy to remember which countries have high and slow spread rate.,Interesting information for the future.,It seems very detailed.,I kind of empathize with the countries that have high spread.,Other than the colors of the chart nothing else is aesthetically pleasing.,This chart can potentially predict the future of these countries.,Not comfortable or uncomfortable.,COVID-12
65,6,7,5,6,3,2,2,COVID,1,"Easily remember the order of the continents, not so easy the numbers.",Interesting data.,Kind of detailed enough.,I can empathize with the number of deaths.,Kind of since it has some color.,Just data.,Not comfortable with seeing number of deaths.,COVID-1
66,6,5,5,5,4,6,6,HousePrice,11,I feel like putting the chart inside a graphic of a house makes it easier to recall due to it being the same topic as the data,It's significantly better than just a bland chart but it feels a bit stale and like average corporation soulless thing,.Gov seams to be a reputable source,I feel like it shows the increase pretty well,It's not terrible but it's not something awe inspiring either,"I mean it's pretty self explanatory, the graphic literally explains the chart",I mean it's pretty non threatening,HousePrice-11
67,2,4,6,3,2,3,4,HousePrice,6,"It looks very generic, and dense","The issue is, when you try to show a lot of data it tends to be easy to just skim over without really caring","Like with the previous chart, the governmental sources seem to be reputable","It feels like it breaks it down too much, it's hard to relate to it",It's too dense,It's a bit dense but gets the point across,non threatening,HousePrice-6
68,5,5,3,6,5,7,4,HousePrice,7,It's easy to read and shows clear data,It's pretty easy to read and gives you the most important part so it's pretty easy to want to find out the rest,"I'm not sure, I haven't heard of the Knight Frank so I'd be skeptical but mostly out of principle",It's easy to relate to the experience of your whole country,It's clear and calm,It's easy to read and practical,"Like with the other charts, it's pretty non threatening, it doesnt really cause discomfort but the data is concerning",HousePrice-7
69,2,4,7,5,4,6,3,HousePrice,8,It feels like the title is easy to forgo and the chart is a bit weird with the scale,"Not particularly, it feels a bit too broad.",Eurostat is very reputable as far as I know,It's pretty easy to empathize with a global change,The scale looks disproportional to the map,Outside of the sizing issue it's easy to read,"It's honestly pretty annoying to look at due to the off-putting sizing, seriously she scale is huge next to the map",HousePrice-8
70,6,6,0,6,7,5,6,HousePrice,9,I think it's pretty eye catching and despite being a bit hard to read it drives the point well,It has a nice aesthetic while being decently easy to read and providing a decent amount of data,Once again I'm just not familiar with the source,I think it shows a national change which is decently easy to empathize with when you get a sense that it's a common issue,The art style is very nice and fitting to teh subject,It's a bit hard to read with the precise scales but not a huge hustle,It's really nice to look at and informative,HousePrice-9
71,3,1,1,2,2,2,3,HousePrice,10,It feels generic and really bland,Lack of a source and a really weird scale,"Same as with interest, there's no source for the information and the scale looks a bit dishonest","It's just genuinely unbelievable, it's very easy to dismiss it
","The background is nice but it has a very Fox News feel to it, it feels very bland and generic while also being terrible to read",The chart feels weird,It just feels clickbaity and dishonest,HousePrice-10
72,6,7,7,7,5,0,4,COVID,5,There is a clear conclusion to the information in the chart,It shows information which affected me personally,It comes from a trusted source,My personal experiences makes the data very relatable and emotional,"It is visually clear and makes some use of colour, the colour gradient is relatable to infection",It doesn't follow any set pattern,There is enough distance for the chart not to be overly emotional but there is still some discomfort in the reading of what was happening,COVID-5
73,2,4,5,2,2,1,6,COVID,12,There is too much information for any one clear message to be recalled,The information it is trying to show is interesting but there is too much clutter,The source is trustworthy but there seems to be a lot of 'best guess' and conflicting theories being represented alongside each other,The numbers are so high and the information scattered over such a large area that it's hard to see it in human terms,The colour scheme is soft and unthreatening but there is no clear guide for where the eye should go and no focal point. It just looks a bit messy at a glance,Much of the information seems disparate,The information seems very impassionate and data driven so there is no sense of unease,COVID-12
74,3,7,3,2,2,6,7,COVID,1,The key data is there and I would remember a snapshot but would not be able to break it down into more specific data,It clearly shows important data and some figures which I found surprising,"Despite the trustworthy source, the simplicity of the charts makes them appear less scientific",The simplicity of the charts makes them feel like basic data rather than relatable figures,it's not interesting although it is very easy to read,The data correlates and it is easy to see links,"Very easy to read, very easy to pull out information",COVID-1
75,6,4,0,5,3,5,6,COVID,2,I would be able to relay the gist of the information and could visualise easily,cases seem fairly consistently split among age groups although slightly surprising it wasn't higher at the younger end,"Not knowing the source makes it difficult to assess, I would have to check source and validity before taking information on board",As a parent I can equate the data with real human experiences,It is very clear and easy to read but feels cold,the chart follows a clear pattern which feels logical,I don't find the chart distressing,COVID-2
76,1,3,7,1,5,0,7,COVID,3,"the data is too varied and I don't recognise any particular patterns, I wouldn't be able to describe what it's telling me easily",The data is too large to pull out any conclusions so it's hard to invest,The chart uses information from a reputable source and clearly utilises large amounts of collated data,I have no emotional attachment or reaction to the information,"The chart looks good and looks like it would be interesting at first glance, the colours used are inviting",I cannot recognise any patterns and my eyes don't know where to focus or how best to read what I'm seeing,The lack of emotional response makes the chart very non-confronting,COVID-3
77,7,3,2,1,3,0,3,COVID,4,Simple data given in a clear visual format,The chart seems fairly basic and the data doesn't draw any conclusions or ask any questions,I don't know the source and it doesn't look professionally produced.,There is no emotive or emotional data,At first glace the colours make it attractive but there isn't enough consideration given to differentiating between colours and it feels low quality,Not giving a source makes the data feel unconnected ,I would feel uncomfortable with using the data,COVID-4
78,3,3,3,1,2,6,3,COVID,4,theres too much countries. You can probably remember the top 3 ,nothing too interesting,no sources , not sure how i would empathize ,too many similar tones of orange and red/purple,pie charts are very common and easy to understand,i dont like that italy is second on the list with less percentage than iran,COVID-4
79,2,6,5,0,5,4,4,COVID,11,too much data. i can remember that its a map chart cause that is not common,I like the idea of a map chart,theres a lot of extra data to back it up and theres a button to download the full data,I do not understand how i would empathize with a chart,I like the map and it makes sense to use different tones of a same color here,"the map is, the chart on the right isnt",its a bit too messy,COVID-11
80,2,6,7,0,3,7,6,COVID,12,too cluttered,I like to see the difference in slopes. For example i like to see the US rapidly increasing,Explanations in multiple notable countries. Sources clearly stated ,Not sure what empathizing with the chart means,background color is ugly. Multiple countries in gray cause clutter in the middle,very easy to understand. Very common type of chart,easy to understand for me,COVID-12
81,7,2,3,0,4,7,6,COVID,1,very simple and clean,not a lot of interesting conclusions can be read from this chart ,Apparently the data is backed by WHO but the full source is not stated ,Not sure what empathizing with a chart means,Very clean but also very boring ,extremely easy to understand,Very simple,COVID-1
82,6,6,7,0,6,5,7,COVID,2,the details might be forgotten but the general trend is easy to understand and remember,It provides more details than just number of cases in general,Sources clearly stated at the bottom,Not sure what empathizing with a chart means,Very clean. Colors are different enough to quickly note the separation,The dates might be confusing at first but after a couple of seconds the chart becomes very obvious,Looks good and trustworthy at the same time,COVID-2
83,1,6,7,0,4,6,6,COVID,3,too much data to remember,very detaied,Sources clearly stated at the bottom,Not sure what empathizing with a chart is,"Not very ""pretty"" but the colors are good to show the difference clearly",Very easy to see the separation ,Easy to understand,COVID-3
84,1,6,6,4,6,2,4,HousePrice,5,A great level of detail here - very hard to remember,The topic is somewhat interesting and relevant ,There appears to be a legitimate source for this information attached.,"With the chart? Not really, though it is a relatable topic","No crazy reason, Its just a nice looking graph",It takes a little bit of thinking about ,Its not wildly confusing or alarming,HousePrice-5
85,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,HousePrice,6,It being colour coded may well make it easy to remember,This information I found to be very interesting ,Chart has a reputable source attached,Soaring house prices is an issue that affects me,Bright and colourful - beautiful graph,"Very easy to understand, clearly labelled","Very intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, clear",HousePrice-6
86,7,6,7,6,4,7,7,HousePrice,7,Its essentially an ordered list of countries. Much of this should stick ,Very unexpected countries making the list here. ,Attached reputable source,House prices increased where I live too,Its not ugly but its also not beautiful. Standard bar chart ,Extremely easy to understand,Nothing about this chart makes me feel uncomfortable,HousePrice-7
87,2,6,3,7,6,5,5,HousePrice,8,"Its a bit complicated, may make it hard to remember",Great amount of detail about many countries - very intersting,Seems something is wrong with the source attached to the chart?,It shows detail about my country and house prices in my country,Its very nearly beautiful but the colour pink being used threw it off. Perhaps if it used a colour complimentary to the green,It takes a little bit of thinking about but essentially yes,Nothing discomforting about it,HousePrice-8
88,2,3,6,3,1,2,2,HousePrice,9,Its not very pretty or legible and its very detailed so hard to remember,It may be a little bit too scientific for the layman (me) to find interesting ,Valid source for information attached,I can empathize with rising house costs but not in the US,Simply quite ugly. Functional yes but not pretty,Takes quite some thinking about ,Its a bit ugly and a bit complicated,HousePrice-9
89,2,6,1,4,3,6,4,HousePrice,10,A graph like this would be very difficult to remember apart from perhaps some key figures,Shows clearly the changes over time,No associated source or company or anything. Anyone could've made this with random figures,"hard to say, again the cost of housing is relevant to me but it doesn't say WHERE this data is for",Not terrible but the background image is a bit jarring,Quite clear to read,The lack of source is perhaps a little discomforting,HousePrice-10
90,7,7,5,7,7,7,4,GlobalWarming,11,Design of the chart makes it easy to remember!,"It is pretty interesting informations presented in a great way - so yes, absolutely.","While this info seems trustworthy, it could really use some source. If i've seen this somewhere it would make me courious, but i'd search for some source.","I mean, kinda, data presented is really sad and it makes me wonder what kind of world will my kids have when they grow up.",Very much so - great representation of those extreme events.,Those graphics and color coding makes it so readable and intuitive - love it!,"Neutral for me - while the chart is done perfectly, data presented itself does not make me comfortable (if this makes sense)",GlobalWarming-11
91,5,6,7,4,5,6,6,GlobalWarming,12,"It kinda is. I guess data is presented properly, and this is interesting. But one of many charts i'll forget over time.","Data itself is interesting, so it makes this chart too.","It is, pretty trustworthy considering all this talk in the media about global warming, and pretty good source makes it perfectly believable.

92,2,4,5,4,3,5,5,GlobalWarming,7,Not really - pretty boring chart that can be easily forgotten just minutes after reading it.,"While the data itself is kind of interesting, the chart itself makes it boring with its design.","It kind of seems trustworthy.

93,4,6,4,2,6,2,2,GlobalWarming,8,"Neutral on this one - seems like i could remember it, or forgot 2 minutes later. Hard for me to say really, just seems weird to me.","Data itself is interesting, but presenting it while not the most readable option, makes it somehow even more.","No source makes it neutral for me. And data itself, could use some more informations.",Nothing to empathize about for me - more making me angry looking at China cause more CO2 emission that whole european union. ,Pretty nice to look at that cause of colours.,"Not really, kind of hard to read exact data.

95,4,5,7,7,3,2,5,GlobalWarming,10,It's pretty popular format of charts so it's easy to forget when u can see hundreds of similar ones.,"Data itself makes it interesting, the design itself is pretty popular and known.","Source is there, and as a person born in Poland i can absolutely believe, that people here do not even believe in climate change, so data seems fine.","Yes, because Poland here is easily visible as one of the most anti-climate change believers. And i can see by my own eyes people refusing to believe in it, so data seems accurate.","Not really. While it's not the worst, the amount of different shades of orange in between 50-30% makes it kind of ugly.","While u can easily read 60-80% ones, amount of shades of orange makes it unreadable for me with 50-30% countries.","It's comfortable enough, while colours makes it weird nothing to be really bothered about.",GlobalWarming-10

690,1,2,7,4,5,7,2,COVID,5,"too many figures, general trend would be simple but specific rate tricky",seeing the effects of covid do not interest me as it was a tough time for all,the references and company who have produced the chart are trustworthy,"i could slightly empathise with the victims of those hospitalised, however the chart does not provoke any direct emotion",follows a wave trend up and down with a sharp top increase,it shows clear knowledge of covid figures,seeing it visuaally the effects of covid have worried me,COVID-5
691,1,7,1,5,7,0,2,COVID,6,lots of information in one small chart,it is a lot more interesting when you can compare which countries had the most new cases or lead to more deaths,no evidence of a source,empathise with the families who have lost loved ones,the colours in the wheel showing a blue into green yellow gradient are satisfying,no evidence of prior knowledge or source,uncomfortable visualising the amount of deaths,COVID-6
692,7,3,0,2,1,0,2,COVID,1,simple chart which follows same pattern as cases will cause deaths,slighlty boring as not much going on in chart,"no direct source, just states it is confirmed by the regions, not where the stats come from",figures dont show emotion for me to empathise,not really pleasing to see a graph which is so simple,no source again provided,shows how regions dealt with cases and how badly europe did,COVID-1
693,1,1,7,4,5,2,1,COVID,2,lots of info about differing ages ,the patients within US healthcare do not interest me,clear evidence of where figures have come from,"slightly, as 2020 was a tough time for the nurses within intensive care","slightly, due to the incline and use of varying shades of blue",confirms most suspicions that the teenagers caught covid the most,feel concerned for the patients ,COVID-2
694,1,1,7,4,1,2,3,COVID,3,"the us map is huge, meaning with coloured annotations it is harder to remember",the vaccination rates do not interest me,taken from the us census,not a topic which i can empathise with,not a fan of the colour schemes of the chart no clear pattern ,"no extra intuition shown, just taken from census ",vaccinations should be taken by all,COVID-3
695,2,5,2,5,6,0,1,COVID,4,lots of different countries with varying stats,shows which countries spreaded the virus more,no sign of a source or where the figures have come from,a global pandemic is very tricky to deal with,"pie charts always look pleasing, with the colurs used it helps to stand out","just stats with countries names, no knowledge or stats",makes me remenber how damaging the virus was,COVID-4
696,1,7,7,7,7,4,2,GlobalWarming,9,Extremely difficult to understand,Looks cool,I think it'll be easy to get these facts,Scary to see the vulnerable countries,It looks very interesting,I believe this chart,Makes me feel very uncomfortable with how spread it is,GlobalWarming-9
697,2,7,2,5,3,1,7,GlobalWarming,10,"The colours are very similar, so it can be hard to remember",Interesting to see the opinion of others ,"Opinion based on people, isn't specified who they are",Climate change is definitely a problem,"It looks nice, but hard to see",No science behind the opinion,I can read it and see everything clearly,GlobalWarming-10
698,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,GlobalWarming,11,The layout allows people to differentiate from the information ,I can see everything that I need to,I think this information can be found out easily,It shows worrying factors from everyday life,The colours and the images are perfect and explain everything easily.,Should be able to find this information out easily.,It makes me feel comfortable and allows me to understand the information properly.,GlobalWarming-11
699,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,GlobalWarming,12,The patterns are all very similar on the chart.,Easy to follow and shows the Earth temperature over the years,Should be easy to find this information,Worrying to see the changes that had happened,I like that all of the graph points are similar,Easy information to work out.,Makes me feel comfortable as the colours are appealing,GlobalWarming-12
700,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,GlobalWarming,1,Hard to split all of them up within the darker colours,Great way to show the world's temperature change,I believe this could be accurate,Scary to see some of the temperature changes,The colours look great,I believe this would be true,I like the overall layout of the chart,GlobalWarming-1
701,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,GlobalWarming,8,I think it's set out very well.,Very interesting to see the changes over the years,Should be easy to calculate,Worrying numbers for some countries ,I like the change of colours and that they are completely separate,I think this looks trustworthy and accurate,Makes me feel at ease ,GlobalWarming-8
702,6,7,6,6,6,6,6,HousePrice,1,"It can be remembered, at least the clear tendency, but maybe the specific details not so much","It shows a reality that affects daily lives and the less chances people have now to actually own a house, which is a global issue","It seems very complete, that can give that feeling","I usually don't think charts make you empathize, but it happens with this one I think, since it's a reality that also affects me in my own country","A lot of colors, it actually looks nice",It's easy to follow,"I do, it's direct with the information it wants to present",HousePrice-1
703,5,6,6,5,6,5,5,HousePrice,8,"Yes but not really, extremes like croatia and germany would be easier to remember","It is, since it shows that the housing issue is dealt differently within europe itself",It looks very detailed and it gives a link to the source,"Yes but not really, like I mentioned before, the housing issue affects me as well, it would be interesting to see what's happening to the countries in which the price is actually going down instead of up","Colors are well chosen, clear distinction","Less intuitive and clear than the other charts, but still understandable",It's a chart that shows different realities within a close region,HousePrice-8
704,3,6,5,5,6,2,2,HousePrice,9,"It feels a bit crowded with information, it seems that the real US housing price hasn't really changed that much while considering inflation, but other aspects are not considered, such as income","It's interesting to go back more than a century before to see how drastically things have changed in the last couple of decades, would be better to see this but updated to 2024 and not only until 2015","Looks complete, but kind of all over the place, not showing income and just inflation takes away a bit of trust","It's an interesting approach to the problem, to show that the real US housing price index hasn't changed that much, even going back to the 1890`s, but still, doesn't consider all information","Colors are well chosen, but it looks better than it reads",Took me longer than the other ones to understand it,"It's an interesting issue but the presentation could have been done better, like the ones that were shown before",HousePrice-9
705,0,0,1,0,5,1,1,HousePrice,10,"It's not easy to understand right away, days, months and years don't seem clearly shown, and why those specific months and years are chosen",The subject itself is interesting but the choice of years and months seems arbitrary,"It seems all over the place, there's no source, looks a bit unprofessional because of it","I would like to but I lack information, it's not layed out like the other charts","it's normal, but it lacks information, makes it weird to look at","I don't understand clearly if the months are considering days or even years, it seems done without much care for the dates","It feels off, the date consideration and even the background image",HousePrice-10
706,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,HousePrice,11,It shows that the difference between prices and inflation is actually lower than it used to be,"It's a very important matter, but at the same time, it shows that the problem could be worse somehow, doesn't consider other factors, such as actual income comparison",It looks actually well done and has a source for it,It's a very important reality that needs to be studied worldwide,"It's the best looking chart so far, it shows the actual problem in a creative way",It's well layed out,"Since it's the best looking one, even though it is a complicated subject, it feels more welcoming ",HousePrice-11
707,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,HousePrice,12,"It shows drastic differences for an important subject, it is, income hasn't gone up as it should have considering inflation and the housing prices","It shows the missing factor of the other charts, the actual income change over the years",It has a source and it's well layed out,"It's an important reality that needs to be studied from every possible angle, this one being the focus on income","It looks very well, but it seems more useful than good for the eyes, unlike the chart that came before, which was very creative","It's easy to read, even though it may seem like a lot of text on  it, it's clearer than others",It shows an important subject using a different approach than the other charts,HousePrice-12
708,5,7,6,7,4,3,4,GlobalWarming,6,Once you get through how this chart is designed it's good. But the first few minutes are irritating.,The topic is interesting and important,"Looks good , not sure but looks good","Sure , important.",Kinda meh.,Not at all,"Once u understand it , sure",GlobalWarming-6
709,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,GlobalWarming,7,Way better than the first one and more obvious in what it wants to convey,"Sure , same topic still good..","If its nasa yes, but there is no real source so idk.",sure,sure,yes,yes,GlobalWarming-7
710,5,7,0,7,6,6,6,GlobalWarming,8,"Yes , since its good designed","Yes , good topic , again ","No clue , no source",yes,"yes, good colors",yes,yes,GlobalWarming-8
711,2,7,4,5,3,1,1,GlobalWarming,9,Not at all ,"Very good topic still , and important","Yes, finally a source","I mean , the topic yes, the design no","My eyes, the colors , oh no ","no, not at all sadly",This chart is everywhere and nowhere,GlobalWarming-9
712,7,7,4,7,4,7,7,GlobalWarming,10,Red=bad,Topic good,Source seems good ,TOpic good,Too much on the red. ,yes,yes,GlobalWarming-10
713,7,7,0,7,7,3,7,GlobalWarming,11,Very good design,"Yes , still good topic",No source,Yes,"Yes , seems very good","looks good ,not really intuitive ",Looks good ,GlobalWarming-11
714,3,2,5,6,4,5,2,COVID,9,The color of the chart makes it a bit difficult to read and understand at first glance. ,Personally I think it's common sense that as we've distributed the vaccine and been in quarantine there would be a major decrease in cases.,The chart looks very professional and well formatted,I've been through quarantine myself like everyone else so it's easy to empathize with the decrease in cases,It does look professionally made but it's a bit hard to understand,Once you use the legend it's not too hard to understand and see the trend,I dont like the manner in which the information is placed on top of each other by year,COVID-9
715,6,5,6,6,7,7,7,COVID,10,The chart is very easy to understand and the major peaks of cases make the chart more memorable,It is mildly interesting to see the points at which covid 19 was at its peak in the United States,The chart feels in line with general information I remember at the time with 2 big covid 19 peaks and the curve going down after,It is very easy to empathize with charts about Covid-19 because it had affected all of us in usually a negative way.,The colors blend well together and  I like the use of a darker tone of red as we reach the peaks of cases,"The chart is very easy to understand at a simple glance and doesn't require any use of a legend, just the 2 axes.",The information is well balanced and specific and I can pinpoint how covid-19 was in a general month,COVID-10
716,3,3,5,3,5,5,5,COVID,11,The chart looks aesthetically pleasing but there is so much going on that it can overload my brain with information. Generally I would remember the big numbers like Ontario and Quebec but the other provinces are easily forgettable ,"It would make sense for the hotspots like Ontario, Alberta British Columbia and Quebec to all receive more covid vaccines. The main point of interest is just the sheer number of vaccines distributed",The chart is pleasing to the eye and doesn't have informatio n that may sound incredibly fake,Most people in Canada had to deal with the controversy regarding the covid-19 vaccine however I don't think the sheer numbers are something to worry about,I like the use of the colours and its pleasing to the eye,It is easy to understand but there is a lot of information at once,I can understand most of the information but the graph on the right can be confusing,COVID-11
717,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,COVID,12,"I like the use of bullet points on the big flatlines in the data, it makes the information more memorable when you give a reason why","It is interesting to note that many of the asian countries are able to slow the spread, and the extra information provides more debate",The chart is properly sourced by a credible recourse and there is contact information as well,Personally I am not from one of the countries listed so I feel much more of an outsider in the chart and being included in the data.,The use of a line graph makes it very aesthetically pleasing and the different colours help differentiate between countries ,The chart is very easy and simple to understand because of the way the countries are seperated,I can understand the information being provided well and it is simple to see the point being made with the data,COVID-12
718,2,5,3,5,2,5,5,COVID,1,I feel like the information is displayed just too simply for me to feel like it has such an impact,"I do think that this can bring some information on the use of strict quarantines. America is much more lenient while southeast asia would be more strict, so even though Asia has  a much higher population the cases are lower",The chart feels a bit poorly made and theres no real sources other than alluding to the world health organization,I can empathize with data regarding deaths and confirmed cases because it is very heavy hitting and personal based on experience.,"The chart is a bit too simple. I also do not like the use of scientific notation at all on the y axis, it would be better to just write the total in a smaller font",It is simple but that makes it easy to understand so long as you understand how to look at scientific notation.,I do understand the chart very well and it's simplicity does make it very comfortable,COVID-1
719,6,6,7,5,6,5,6,COVID,8,I do like the way the information is organized and the way its organized where the highest population is at the top makes it super memorable,It is very interesting to see the number of tests based on population which is something not talked about much,There is a clear trustworthy journal logo at the bottom and a source,I feel like most people had been tested by covid-19 before and it is easy to empathize with what the chart means and the flatting of the curve.,The use of bubbles makes the chart very easy to understand and I like the way its formatted where the 2 extremes are at opposite ends,At first glance it looks a bit weird but once you look at the legend it becomes very easy to understand,I can get all the information I wish pertaining to the chart without having to look at a legend or other parts.,COVID-8
720,6,7,6,4,6,5,7,GlobalWarming,5,Because of the clear colours used on and also the layout,The chart has good graphics,The rising of the graph is gradually,The chart has good font size used,it has good layout,Allows users grasp key points at a glance,One cannot struggle interpreting it,GlobalWarming-5
